## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?

  This article resonated with me more as a wakeup call than anything else. I used to do a good many of these but not so much these days. I used to read all the time and I used to have a strong growth mindset. I'm definitely going to work on incorporating those two back into my life. I do already take regular breaks while working and I love to teach others what I know. Even if no one is around I will explain things out loud just so I can get the experience.  

1. How would you print the string `"Hello World!"` to the terminal?
 #open an atom project and type p '"Hello World!"' and then run the file using ruby.

1. What character is used to indicate comments in a ruby file?
   # The "#" denotes comments in a ruby file.

1. Explain the difference between an integer and a float?
   # An integer is a whole number while a float is a whole number that includes the decimals

1. In the space below, create a variable `animal` that holds the string `"zebra"`
  animal = 'zebra'

1. How would you print the string `"zebra"` using the variable that you created above?

  p animal

1. What is interpolation? Use interpolation to print a sentence using the variable `animal`.

  Interpolation allows for ruby code to be included and executed inside a string.

  p "Is your favorite animal a #{animal}?"

1. What method is used to get input from a user?

  gets

1. Name and describe two common string methods:
  If you use the .size method on a string you get a result of the total number of characters in the string.
  If you use the .capitalize method on a string then your string will be capitalized when printed.
