## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?

I really appreciate reading about how mistakes are essential to learning and that they are part of the process.
The part about seeking help as part of a growth mindset was new to me, but I see what they mean when they say it's a strength.

1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
I demonstrate the growth mindset because I do ask questions when I know I'm not understanding something. Not getting hung up on mistakes is my biggest short coming from the reading. Knowing that's part of the process is reassuring to read about.

1. What is a Hash, and how is it different from an Array?
Arrays and hashes are similar but arrays are more restrictive. Arrays are for lists that are ordered, hashes are for lists without any specific order. You can name keys in a hash a number which you can not do with array elements.

1. In the space below, create a Hash stored to a variable named `pet_store`.  This hash should hold an inventory of items and the number of that item that you might find at a pet store.
pet_store = {leashes: 10, waterbowls: 20, catfood: 20, dogfood: 15}

1. Given the following `states = {"CO" => "Colorado", "IA" => "Iowa", "OK" => "Oklahoma"}`, how would you access the value `"Iowa"`?
states["IA"]

1. With the same hash above, how would we get all the keys?  How about all the values?
states.keys   states.values

1. What is another example of when we might use a hash?  In your example, why is a hash better than an array?
A hash could be used to store the information required to mail someone a letter. Arrays are more restrictive than a hash. Hashes are unordered lists while arrays are ordered lists.

1. What questions do you still have about hashes?
I have a lot of questions. I think I will have to practice some more with them to better understand my questions.
